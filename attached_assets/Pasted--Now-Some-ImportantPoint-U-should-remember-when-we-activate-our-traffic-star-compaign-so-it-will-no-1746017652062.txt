{ Now Some ImportantPoint U should remember when we activate our traffic star compaign so it will not directly compaign activate api request so first it will send Api request to check compaign status api what is status for current stats active/pause if we got response compaign is paused then we will make api request which make compaign as activate same for pause action before pausing campaign we will fetch current status of campaign and after getting response we will decide we have to send pause request or not if status of trafficstar campaign is already paused then we will not do anything we will simply skip for pause if it's get response caompaign as already paused. Also{ if we pause our traffic star compaign then we will continue check { remember we will check not directly update activate first check compaign status if we not found paused we will pause it same for start if we start and compaign found paused before pause eligible it will auto start}

Now last step we have to implement when our 6th step has been run by adding pending click value in daily spent value of traffic star campaign if we got new url click value in our site campaign then we will plus their budget in daily budget 112.098$ for example we got a url after update exist click value to 112.098$ and got new url for 1000 required click quantity so value of required click by 1000 is 1$ then we will update traffic star daily budget to 112.098$+1$= 113.098$ but here is some limitation if we got any new url then 1$ budget will not update immediately to traffic star daily budget as 113.098$ it will wait for 12 minute before adding 113.098$ so after 12 minute all pending url which added to our compaign their all pending required click value will be plus in 112.098$ suppose we got 1 url and wait for 12 minute and in 12 minute waiting we got also new url so when we will update traffic star daily budget we will calculate all url pending click budget which we received in 12 minute interval and will plus all to 112.098$ and will update to traffic star daily budget this process will be run continuously until I stop/pause *Traffic sender*
