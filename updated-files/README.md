# Updated Fixed Files

This directory contains updated versions of files with fixes for:

1. High-spend budget calculation bug where URLs that transition from 'active' to 'complete' during the 9-minute waiting period weren't being counted
2. Field reference inconsistencies between `trafficstarCampaignId` (TypeScript) and `trafficstar_campaign_id` (referenced incorrectly)
3. Missing SQL operator imports causing "or is not defined" errors

## Implementation Strategy

1. Created helper functions in `url-status-helper.ts` and `high-spend-fix.ts`
2. Fixed direct errors in `traffic-generator-new.ts`
3. Added consistent helper function for accessing TrafficStar campaign IDs

## Files

- `url-status-helper.ts`: New helper for accessing URLs by status
- `high-spend-fix.ts`: Fixed implementation of the budget calculation logic
- `traffic-generator-fixed.ts`: Fixed version of traffic-generator-new.ts (for reference)

## Deployment Instructions

The main files have already been updated in place:

1. Added import for `or` operator from drizzle-orm 
2. Created helper functions for consistent field access
3. Updated SQL queries to use direct SQL for better stability
4. Fixed campaign field reference inconsistencies
